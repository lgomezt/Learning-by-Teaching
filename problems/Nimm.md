title: "Nimm Game Problem"
description: "Nimm is a simple turn-based game where players take turns removing 1 or 2 stones from a shared pile, and the player who takes the last stone loses. In this version, the task is to simulate a single-player version where a loop repeatedly asks the user how many stones to take, updates the total, and ends when no stones remain. \n\n This problem is designed to teach basic control flow concepts — especially loops, conditionals, and user input."

# Problem Statement
## Description
**Nimm** is an ancient game of strategy that is named after the old German word for "take". It is also called *Tiouk Tiouk* in West Africa and *Tsynshidzi* in China. Players alternate taking stones until there are zero left. The game of Nimm goes as follows:

1. The game starts with a pile of 20 stones between the players
2. The two players alternate turns
3. On a given turn, a player may take either 1 or 2 stones from the center pile

The two players continue until the center pile has run out of stones.

The last player to take a stone loses.

> We have broken the problem down into three smaller milestones so you can build the solution step by step. 

## Task

**Milestone 1**

You’ll write a `loop` to remove stones from a pile.

1. **Start with 20 stones.**

**Milestone 2**
2. **Repeat this process until there are zero stones left:**
    - Print how many stones are left.  
      _Example:_ `There are 20 stones left`
    - Ask the user how many stones to remove — using this code:  
      ```python
      int(input("Would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? "))
      ```
    - Subtract that number of stones from the total.
    - Add an empty `print()` between turns (to make the output easier to read).

**Milestone 3**
1. **End the game when there are no stones left.**  
   _Print:_ `Game over`

**Important:**  
- For now, don’t worry about whose turn it is.  
- Don’t worry about making sure the user enters only 1 or 2 stones — any number is fine in this step.

## Example output: 
```
There are 20 stones left
Would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 2

There are 18 stones left
Would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 17

There are 1 stones left
Would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 3

Game over
```

## Evaluation

## Lesson Goals

- initialize and update a state variable (stone count),
- use a while loop with a clear termination condition, 
- read and convert user input with input() and int(), 
- perform arithmetic updates to mutate program state, 
- print state each iteration for user feedback, 
- trigger a post-loop action when the end condition is met ('Game over'), 
- practice reasoning about loop invariants and preventing infinite loops

## Common Mistakes

- forgetting to initialize the stone count variable, 
- using assignment (=) instead of comparison (==) in loop condition, 
- loop condition written incorrectly (e.g., while stones > 0 vs while stones >= 0), 
- not updating the stone count inside the loop, 
- subtracting stones before checking input validity, 
- input not converted to int (leads to string concatenation instead of arithmetic), 
- using input() without casting and trying to subtract a string from an integer, 
- placing print statements outside of the loop so they only run once, 
- off-by-one error in ending condition (ending too early or too late), 
- forgetting to decrement the pile when stones = 1 or 2, 
- not handling negative stone counts if user enters a big number, 
- infinite loop caused by never reaching zero, 
- forgetting to break out of the loop when stones = 0, 
- bad indentation causing code not to run inside the loop, 
- using == instead of > or >= in loop condition, causing game to skip iterations, 
- forgetting parentheses in print(), e.g., print ‘Game over’, 
- using == for assignment in Python (syntax error), 
- forgetting to add spacing print() leading to unreadable output, 
- not resetting or reusing variable names consistently, 
- ignoring edge cases like removing 0 stones or too many stones

## Suggested Answer
```python
# Start with 20 stones
stones = 20

# Repeat until there are zero stones left
while stones > 0:
    print(f"There are {stones} stones left")
    remove = int(input("Would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? "))
    stones -= remove
    print()

# End of the game
print("Game over")
```
